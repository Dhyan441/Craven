# Craven üç™ üîê

---

## What We Live By  
**Craven** is the essential tool for keeping your roommates in check and your snacks in stock.

---

## Project Overview  
Craven utilizes facial recognition technology to detect and identify who has been sneaking into your snack stash. Say goodbye to stolen Oreos and the frustration of disappearing food. With Craven, you can track and hold your roommates accountable when they help themselves to your goodies without asking.

---

## Motivation  
We‚Äôre fed up with our roommates stealing food from our designated kitchen cupboards. Few things are as soul-crushing as coming home after a long day and finding that someone has eaten the last Oreo cookie you had been saving. The university student population is in desperate need of an inexpensive, lightweight security solution to keep intruders out of our snacks.
